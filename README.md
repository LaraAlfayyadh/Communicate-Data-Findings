#### I completed this project as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## Dataset

> The data consist of approximately 311894 bike rides from 2018( Jan-Dec). The attributes include the trip start/end time, start/end station, duration as well as additional information such as Pass holder Type. The dataset was quite clear.

## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there are five types of Pass holder  using the system: Monthly and Annual Pass who are mainly daily commuters, having short trips, and who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9 am and 4-6 pm. On the other hand, the Walk-up, One Day Pass and Flex Pass which I believe they a tourists or occasional riders who use the system more on weekends to explore the Bay Area. However, the bike-share system being used more during spring and summertime.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For my presentation, I focus on monthly use of the bike sharing system, it's show the August is has the highest number of rides. 
Then I plot the number of bike rides (trips) for each day based on passholder type that mean it's plot the number of trips for evryday to show trips number for each passholder type on all days. 
In the end I show the Hourly use during the weekday for Walk-up and Monthly Pass based on month to show peak hour for Walk-up and  Monthly Pass.
